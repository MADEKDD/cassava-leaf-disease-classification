## Dataset
Download dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-leaf-disease-classification/data), indicate path in file entities/configs/configs.yaml.
Following paths should be set:
`
* data_path: "../../input/cassava-leaf-disease-classification/"
* train_csv_data_path: "../../input/cassava-leaf-disease-classification/train.csv"
* label_json_data_path: "../../input/cassava-leaf-disease-classification/label_num_to_disease_map.json"
* train_img_path: "../../input/cassava-leaf-disease-classification/train_images/"
* test_img_path: "../../input/cassava-leaf-disease-classification/test_images/"`

## Start
Change directory to cassava-leaf-disease-classification folder.
`cd cassava-leaf-disease-classification folder/`
Configs for modifications can be found in yaml entities/configs/configs.yaml.

## Enviroment
* Activate virtual environnment
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## EDA in jupyter notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/cassava-leaf-disease-classification.ipynb
```

## Training

```bash
!python3 train_pipeline.py entities/configs/configs.yaml
```

## Prediction
for making prediction copy pictures to test_images folder and run:
```bash
!python3 predict_pipeline.py entities/configs/predict_config.yaml.yaml
```
after the prediction is finished open the file result.csv

## Local project testing
```bash
pytest -v . (not ready yet)
```

## Check code style with pylint
```bash
pylint cassava-leaf-disease-classification --disable=C0114,C0115,C0116 --fail-under=7.0 (not ready yet)
```
